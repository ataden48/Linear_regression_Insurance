# Linear regression insurance


## Project Description
In this project, we conducted training of a linear regression model to predict numerical values based on a limited dataset. However, due to the small size of the dataset, we faced limitations in achieving the expected results.

## Limitations of Small Dataset
The small size of the dataset limited the model's ability to capture significant patterns and relationships. It could also lead to overfitting the model and its inability to generalize knowledge to new observations.

## Suggestions for Improvement
To improve the performance and reliability of the model, it is recommended to use a larger and more diverse dataset. This will allow the model to learn better and make more accurate predictions on real-world data.
